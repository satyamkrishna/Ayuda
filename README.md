Ayuda is a non-governmental organization whose aim is to provide assistance to underprivileged schools and children .The goals are to establish a firm student volunteer network which is widespread, multilingual, multi talented and most importantly committed towards the purpose. It also want to make this network easily accessible to the string of underprivileged schools in India and millions of poverty ridden children who do not have basic support to study and grow in life but strive to do so. By making our operations online we want to involve a greater helping population and make it more transparent and easy to approach. As the founding members are students, the organisation understands and relates to the youth of the country and wants to help millions of students to realise their dream of helping build a better country. Ayuda also conduct various campaigns and teaching workshops in underprivileged schools on regular basis. The interested person registers himself online as a volunteer and the tasks the organization receives through various schools or other organisations are assigned to the appropriate volunteer base.
